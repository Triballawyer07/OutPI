This version shouldn't be used unless you absolutely need it, these files will most likely not be updated with each version. If these files no
longer work you will most likely have to fix it yourself. There is a chance that this file will break with each update of the game as you will have to edit the .lua files inside
BeamNG.

Only use this if you can't live without:
Low fuel light, Check engine light,
4WD light, Range Indicator,
Radiator Leak light,
Overrev Damage light,
